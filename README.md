Web scraping consists of gathering data available on websites. This can be done manually by a human 
or by using a bot.

A bot is a program you build that helps you extract the data you need much quicker than a human’s 
hand and eyes can.

To source data for ML, AI, or data science projects, you’ll often rely on databases, APIs, or 
ready-made CSV datasets. But what if you can’t find a dataset you want to use and analyze? That’s 
where a web scraper comes in.
