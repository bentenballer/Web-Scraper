#Web Scraper

###What’s Web Scraping?

- Web scraping consists of gathering data available on websites. This can be done manually by a human or by using a bot. A bot is a program you build that helps you extract the data you need much quicker than a human’s hand and eyes can.

###Why Web Scraping?
- To source data for ML, AI, or data science projects, you’ll often rely on databases, APIs, or 
ready-made CSV datasets. But what if you can’t find a dataset you want to use and analyze? That’s 
where a web scraper comes in.

###What this project will cover?
- This project will scrape data from IMDb’s “Top 1,000” movies, specifically the top 50 movies. The purpose is to gather the following information from each movie:
  1. The title
  2. The year it was released
  3. How long the movie is
  4. IMDb’s rating of the movie
  5. The Metascore of the movie
  6. How many votes the movie got
  7. The U.S. gross earnings of the movie
